## 3.1.0
- **New — `LiquidGlassBlender`:** blend two to six `LiquidGlassLens` descendants into one liquid surface. Neighbouring lenses fuse with a smooth metaball bridge as they meet and pull apart as they separate, while each member keeps its own corner style. Place it inside a `LiquidGlassView` and it works on **both backends** — Impeller samples the live backdrop, Skia refracts the captured background.
- **Metaball gradient split:** the merged-field normal uses the hardware-derivative 1-tap on Impeller and a 5-tap central difference on Skia (whose SkSL has no `dFdx`), selected per backend so the blend loads and renders on both.
- **Single-lens shaders** now use the exact 5-tap gradient for every corner style.
- Chromatic aberration on the Skia blend path is now applied **after** the blur (matching Impeller's order); in-shader blur is disabled on the Skia blend path for now.
- **Note:** the blend is **not optimized for Skia yet** — it works on the Skia capture path but can be heavy there; best performance is on Impeller for now.

## 3.0.0
- **New — lens anywhere:** `LiquidGlassLens` is a layout-driven lens you can drop anywhere in the widget tree (no position/size params; size comes from layout). It **supports both Impeller and Skia automatically**, resolving the best render path for the running engine: on Impeller it refracts the **live backdrop** with no `LiquidGlassView` and no background widget at all; on Skia it refracts an ancestor `LiquidGlassView`'s captured background, and gracefully degrades to a frosted look when neither is available.
- **New:** `LiquidGlassStyle` — one shared descriptor (**shape + appearance + refraction**) for every glass surface (lens, components, nav pill), with `copyWith(...)` and `merge(...)`.
- **New — jelly motion:** the `LiquidGlassSlider`, `LiquidGlassToggle`, and `LiquidGlassBottomNavBar` now share an iOS-style jelly spring — squash/stretch with a direction-memory spring and momentum-sided squash. The slider/toggle thumb stretches toward its travel and snaps back, and the nav bar's selection pill springs between items. Exposed standalone as the reusable `LiquidGlassJelly` widget.
- **New components:** `LiquidGlassSlider`, `LiquidGlassToggle`, `LiquidGlassAppBar`, `LiquidGlassScaffold` (owns the glass pipeline), `LiquidGlassDraggable`, and `LiquidGlassJelly` join the existing `LiquidGlassButton`, `LiquidGlassBottomNavBar`, and `LiquidGlassTabBar`.
- **Migration:** the old position-driven lens API (`LiquidGlass`) is superseded by `LiquidGlassLens` and the drop-in components; write new code against `LiquidGlassLens`.
- **Breaking:** removed the `LiquidGlassSearchBar` component.
- **Breaking:** `LiquidGlassAppIcon` and `LiquidGlassDock` are no longer part of the public API (kept internally for maintenance).
- Rewrote the README around the lens-anywhere API and consolidated the example into a single `main.dart` gallery whose home menu opens each demo as its own route.
- **New shape:** `LiquidGlassShape.continuousRoundedRectangle(...)` — an **Apple capsule-style** continuous rounded rectangle, now the **default** shape; it collapses to a clean capsule at full corner radius.
- **Breaking:** removed `SuperellipseShape`; its L^n squircle now lives on `LiquidGlassShape.squircle(...)` (same iOS-style continuous-curvature look) and ships with **its own exact, shader-matched `ClipPath` clipper** (via `clipQuality: LiquidGlassClipQuality.exact`). The old superellipse had no exact Flutter clip path, which forced a rectangle clip and capped its blur; the squircle's dedicated clipper now matches the SDF the shader draws and blurs correctly at any sigma.
- Shapes are now selected via the `LiquidGlassShape.roundedRectangle(...)` / `.squircle(...)` / `.continuousRoundedRectangle(...)` convenience constructors (a single `cornerStyle` vocabulary) instead of separate `RoundedRectangleShape` / `SuperellipseShape` classes.
- Simplified the shaders: removed the superellipse SDF branch and the `u_shapeType` uniform, so every lens now uses the analytic rounded-rect path.
- Added `LiquidGlassView.regionCapture` (off by default): per-lens region capture on the Skia sync path — each capture grabs only every lens's own rect (+ margin) instead of the whole background. A performance win when lenses cover a small part of a large background; no effect on Impeller.

## 2.0.1
- Fixed lens position being clamped to the parent bounds even when `outOfBoundaries: true`. A lens moved past the parent's edge (in any direction) now keeps its true position instead of being pinned, so spacing between lenses stays correct.

## 2.0.0
- Added **optical border mode** (`OpticalBorder`) — Apple-style, SDF-based rim lighting with background-tinted highlights, dual-sided specular reflections, and a lens height profile — alongside the existing `ClassicBorder`.
- Added new ready-made components: `LiquidGlassButton`, `LiquidGlassSearchBar`, `LiquidGlassAppIcon`, `LiquidGlassDock`, `LiquidGlassTabBar`, and `LiquidGlassBottomNavBar`.
- Improved rendering stability on release/profile builds with Impeller.
- Fixed lens and border content rendering upside down on Impeller's OpenGL ES backend (older Android devices) by inverting the texture sample Y-axis under `IMPELLER_TARGET_OPENGLES`.
- **Breaking:** `oneSideLightIntensity` and `doubleSideLightIntensity` moved from the shape to `ClassicBorder`. Pass them via `borderType: ClassicBorder(...)` instead of directly on the shape.

## 1.1.1
- Formatted the dart files and changed the size of the thumbnail of screenshot.

## 1.1.0
- Added new refraction modes: **shape refraction** and **radial refraction**.
- Added new light modes: **edge** and **radial**.
- Added **chromatic aberration** support.
- Added **one side light intensity** support.
- Added **saturation** control.
- Updated magnification behavior to apply to the entire lens area rather than only the distortion region.
- Improved and optimized shader code.
- Removed `highDistortionOnCurves`; the same effect can now be achieved by increasing `distortion` and setting `distortionWidth` to half of the smallest lens dimension.
